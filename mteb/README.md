## Installation
We have modified the original MTEB to include a new measurement of cognitive load for the embeddings for interpretable models. Unnecessary files have been removed from the original MTEB repository. 
```bash
pip install .
```
Please refer to the original [MTEB Repository](https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb) for more information.
